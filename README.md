# gagamush
gagamush is a word invented by my son Jordan. meaningless for you, but for us it never fails to stirr up laughter.
my son is very creative as he often invent ideas that are completely out of the box. sometimes crazy ideas such as creating mixture of toothpaste, shaving foam, soap, ground papper and some other 'ingridients' to create poison. the poison was meant to paralize any burglar break through our house.
